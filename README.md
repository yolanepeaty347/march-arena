# March Madness AI

An AI-powered NCAA Tournament bracket simulator built with Next.js and Claude Haiku. Watch the full 2026 bracket unfold in real time as an AI analyst picks every game, from the First Four through the national championship, using KenPom ratings, historical seed data, and matchup context.

## How It Works

1. **Hit "Start simulation"** — the app kicks off a durable workflow that simulates every tournament game
2. **Games stream in round by round** — results appear on the bracket as NDJSON updates, with the sidebar cycling through active matchups
3. **Each pick is made by Claude 4.5 Haiku** — the model receives team profiles, KenPom stats, venue/travel context, historical seed matchup records (1985–2025), and upset indicators, then returns a structured `{ winner, reasoning }` response
4. **Win probabilities** drive the analysis — an ensemble of KenPom logistic (60%), Log5 (25%), and seed-based (15%) models
5. **Results aggregate into a leaderboard** — champions, Final Four appearances, and upset wins across simulation runs, stored in Redis
